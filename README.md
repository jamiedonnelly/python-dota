# python-dota

This is a python interface for the OpenDotaAPI (https://docs.opendota.com/) to access match data and other Dota 2 statistics.

This library defines a client python class through which users can choose to utilise their own API-key (Paid subscriptions and premia on API calls)
and a collection of methods to easily extract desired data.
